# User-Managment-Rest-API
The User Management REST API is a robust and scalable solution for handling user-related operations in web applications, built using Spring Boot framework. This open-source project is hosted on GitHub and offers a comprehensive set of endpoints for creating, updating, fetching, and deleting user information.

# Key Features:

 User CRUD Operations: The API provides endpoints to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user entities. Users can be created with essential details like name, email, password, and additional optional fields.
 Validation and Error Handling: The API incorporates robust validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity and prevent invalid data from being processed. It also provides detailed error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes for client-side error handling.
 Swagger Documentation: The API comes with Swagger documentation, making it easier for developers to explore the available endpoints, request and response formats, and sample payloads.
 Exception Handling: The API implements proper exception handling to handle unforeseen scenarios gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to clients.
